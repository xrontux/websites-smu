            Nielson's first heuristic : the system should always keep users informed about its current state.
            When a user is aware of system states, he can actively change them, hence imparting him with control.

        <p>
            To keep the user up to date on its status, a system should also be able to provide immediate feedback
            to a user's actions. When I press a button, I expect the button to tell me that it has been pressed.
            Deprived of responsiveness, a user will end up feeling helpless and frustrated.

            Nielson's second heuristic : the system should talk to the user in layman's terms, not in technical ones.
            Complicated language repels, understandable language attracts. If you have no choice but to use technical acronyms,
            explain them - don't make users leave the page to Google.

            Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit"
            to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. For example, a popular
            alternative is the &quot;undo&quot; button.
            <br />
            <br />

            Another alternative would be to code the website such that when pressing a link, a new tab will be
            automatically opened so that the user is free to visit the previous page by switching tabs, allowing the
            user to experience freedom when navigating the website

        <h3>CONSISTENCY &amp; STANDARDS</h3>
        <p>Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the
            same thing. Follow platform conventions.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="no5">
        <h3>ERROR PREVENTION</h3>
        <p>One of the 10 Usability Heuristics advises that it’s important to communicate errors to users gracefully,
            actionably, and clearly. However, it’s even better to prevent users from making errors in the first place

            A crucial point in discussing user errors is where to assign the blame for the error. The term “user error”
            implies that the user is at fault for having done something wrong. Not so. The designer is at fault for
            making it too easy for the user to commit the error. Therefore, the solution to user errors is not to scold
            users, to ask them to try harder, or to give them more extensive training. The answer is to redesign the
            system to be less error prone.
            <ul>
                <li>Slips occur when users intend to perform one action, but end up doing another (often similar)
                    action. For example, typing an “i” instead of an “o” counts as a slip; accidentally putting liquid
                    hand soap on one’s toothbrush instead of toothpaste is also a slip. Slips are typically made when
                    users are on autopilot, and when they do not fully devote their attention resources to the task at
                    hand.</li>
                <li>Mistakes are made when users have goals that are inappropriate for the current problem or task;
                    even if they take the right steps to complete their goals, the steps will result in an error. For
                    example, if I misunderstood the meaning of the oil-pressure warning light in my car, and thought it
                    was the tire-pressure monitor, no matter how carefully I added air to my tires, it would not fix
                    the issue with my oil pressure. This would be a mistake, since the goal that I was attempting to
                    accomplish was inappropriate for the situation, even though I made no errors in executing my plan.
                    Mistakes are conscious errors, and often (though not exclusively) arise when a user has incomplete
                    or incorrect information about the task, and develops a mental model that doesn’t match how the
                    interface actually works.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible (Windows famous ribbon
            logo). The user
            should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another.
            Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever
            appropriate.</p>

    <section id="no7">
        <h3>FLEXIBILITY &amp; EFFICIENCY OF USE</h3>
        <p>Accelerators -- unseen by the novice user -- may often speed up the interaction for the expert
            user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow
            users to tailor frequent actions.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="no8">
        <h3>AESTHETIC &amp; MINIMALIST DESIGN</h3>
        <p>Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra
            unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and
            diminishes their relative visibility.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="no9">
        <h3>HELP USERS RECOGNISE, DIAGNOSE, &amp; RECOVER FROM ERRORS</h3>
        <p>Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the
            problem, and constructively suggest a solution.</p>
    </section>


    <section id="no10">
        <h3>HELP &amp; DOCUMENTATION</h3>
        <p>Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be
            necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to
            search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.</p>
