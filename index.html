        <h3>Visibiltiy Of System Status</h3>
        <p>The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate
                feedback within reasonable time.
        The first of Jakob Nielsen’s ten heuristics — visibility of system status — relates to so much more than user-interface design. At its essence, it is about communication and transparency, which are critical to many aspects of life. People strive for predictability and control, and, in most cases, more information translates to better decision making.

     Wherever you are, whatever you are doing, take a few moments to look around and note the various types of systems around you, and how they communicate their current status. Your phone or laptop display how much battery life remains; your email application tells you how many unread emails you have; a sign in the subway indicates the next stop (or, if you’ve missed the last one, how many minutes until the next train arrives at the station). All these nuggets of information allow you to accurately assess the current state of the systems you interact with.
                
    Definition: The visibility of system status refers to how well the state of the system is conveyed to its users. Ideally, systems should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.</p>

        <h3>Match Between System &amp; Real World</h3>
        <p>
                

               The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.
                
                As UX professionals, we should never assume that our own interpretations and understanding of words or objects match those of our users. (You ≠ user, as it says on our T-shirts.) How we interpret the world around us depends on a variety of circumstantial and personal factors. Experiences we’ve had, items we’re familiar with, our beliefs, ideas, and values all contribute to how we infer meaning, and nuances in interpretation will often vary from individual to individual.

        <h3>User Control &amp; Freedom</h3>
        <p>Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.</p>
    </section>


    <section id="no4">
        <h3>Consistancy &amp; Standards</h3>
        <p>Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the
                same thing. Follow platform conventions.</p>
